             <LatinPrayerName>Matthew 16:18-19</LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven. </EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>Et ego dico tibi quia tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevalebunt adversum eam. Et tibi dabo claves regni caelorum et quodcumque ligaveris super terram erit ligatum in caelis et quodcumque solveris super terram erit solutum in caelis </LatinPrayer>

             <LatinPrayerName>I Peter 3:21</LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>Quod et vos nunc similis formae salvos facit baptisma non carnis depositio sordium sed conscientiae bonae interrogatio in Deum per resurrectionem Iesu Christi.</LatinPrayer>

          <John2020>
             <EnglishPrayerName>John 20:20-23</EnglishPrayerName>
             <LatinPrayerName>John 20:20-23</LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.</EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>Et hoc cum dixisset ostendit eis manus et latus gavisi sunt ergo discipuli viso Domino dixit ergo eis iterum pax vobis sicut misit me Pater et ego mitto vos hoc cum dixisset insuflavit et dicit eis accipite Spiritum Sanctum quorum remiseritis peccata remittuntur eis quorum retinueritis detenta sunt.</LatinPrayer>

         <John653>
             <EnglishPrayerName>John 6:53-67 </EnglishPrayerName>
             <LatinPrayerName>John 6:53-67 </LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me: and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever. These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in Capharnaum. Many therefore of his disciples, hearing it, said: This saying is hard; and who can hear it? But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them: Doth this scandalize you? If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who he was that would betray him. And he said: Therefore did I say to you that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father. After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
</EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>Dixit ergo eis Iesus amen amen dico vobis nisi manducaveritis carnem Filii hominis et biberitis eius sanguinem non habetis vitam in vobis qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem habet vitam aeternam et ego resuscitabo eum in novissimo die caro enim mea vere est cibus et sanguis meus vere est potus qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem in me manet et ego in illo sicut misit me vivens Pater et ego vivo propter Patrem et qui manducat me et ipse vivet propter me hic est panis qui de caelo descendit non sicut manducaverunt patres vestri manna et mortui sunt qui manducat hunc panem vivet in aeternum haec dixit in synagoga docens in Capharnaum. Multi ergo audientes ex discipulis eius dixerunt durus est hic sermo quis potest eum audire 61 sciens autem Iesus apud semet ipsum quia murmurarent de hoc discipuli eius dixit eis hoc vos scandalizat si ergo videritis Filium hominis ascendentem ubi erat prius spiritus est qui vivificat caro non prodest quicquam verba quae ego locutus sum vobis spiritus et vita sunt sed sunt quidam ex vobis qui non credunt sciebat enim ab initio Iesus qui essent credentes et quis traditurus esset eum. Et dicebat propterea dixi vobis quia nemo potest venire ad me nisi fuerit ei datum a Patre meo 66 ex hoc multi discipulorum eius abierunt retro et iam non cum illo ambulabant dixit ergo Iesus ad duodecim numquid et vos vultis abire</LatinPrayer>

             <LatinPrayerName>I Corinthians 11:27</LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
</EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>Quotienscumque enim manducabitis panem hunc et calicem bibetis mortem Domini adnuntiatis donec veniat .</LatinPrayer>

             <LatinPrayerName>James 5:14-15</LatinPrayerName>
             <EnglishPrayer>Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. </EnglishPrayer>
             <LatinPrayer>infirmatur quis in vobis inducat presbyteros ecclesiae et orent super eum unguentes eum oleo in nomine Domini et oratio fidei salvabit infirmum et adlevabit eum Dominus et si in peccatis sit dimittentur ei </LatinPrayer>
