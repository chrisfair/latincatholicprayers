    Description:
       Catholic Prayers in Latin and English.  Any number of prayers can be
       added to any given prayer list provided that the number isn't so large
       that a given computer has a hard time parsing the list.  As a rule
       of thumb I am restricting each file to approximately ten prayers maximum
       feel free to expand as you see fit.  However it isn't really necessary
       any number of additional prayer lists can also be added provided that
       the ListOfPrayerLists.xml is updated with the necessary information.  If
       this is the original python version of the program any lists added to the
       ListOfLists will automatically be added to the program.  Accompanying
       sound files for each prayer can be added to the SoundFile directory and
       should be named after the tag appended with .ogg (and should be ogg vobis
       format as well).
