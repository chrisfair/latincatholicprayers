Latin Prayer memorizer

This isn't to terribly complicated, it is a simple python2 script to allow the memorization of latin prayers. 
It includes whitakers words and uses it so that a person can double click a word and get the latin grammar
out of it.  A person can 1) View the English prayer 2) View the Latin prayer 3) Do a quiz on either the English or the Latin prayer 
4) Hear the prayer pronounced in Latin (my own somewhat dubious rendition sorry for those who endure it)
